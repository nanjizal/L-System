L-System
========

Lindenmayer system implemented in Haxe using the Luxe engine, forked and now under adjustment to allow use not only with Luxe but potentially with other toolkits and possible 3D L-Systems, for instance LuxeLNode class could be implement on another target with Quaternion and a 3D vector.
